HOW TO DOWNLOAD A CHROME EXTENSION
1) Download the extension from GitHub

- Option A: ZIP download (easiest)
- Open the GitHub repo page.
- Click Code → Download ZIP.
- Unzip it somewhere you can find again (Desktop is fine).
  
- Option B: Git clone (if you use git)
- Clone the repo to a folder on your computer.
- 4) Find the correct extension folder (important)
- When you unzip, you often get a folder like:
- some-extension-main/
- Inside that, you must locate the folder that contains the extension’s manifest file:
- Manifest V3: manifest.json
- Manifest V2 (older): also manifest.json
- ✅ The folder you load in Chrome must be the one that directly contains manifest.json (not one level above it).
- 3) Open Chrome’s Extensions page
- Open Chrome.
- Go to: chrome://extensions/
- Turn on the toggle in the top-right: Developer mode
- 4) Load it as an unpacked extension
- Click Load unpacked
- Select the folder that contains manifest.json
- Click Select Folder
- If it loads correctly, you’ll see the extension appear in your list.
- 5) Pin it (so you can use it easily)
- Click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions) in the Chrome toolbar
- Find your extension
- Click the pin icon
